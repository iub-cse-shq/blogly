For this project we developed a NodeJs Application
Using Express for Routing
And MongoDB for the Database.

We followed the MVC Paradigm.

The folders corrospond to the MVC (models, views, controllers).

In the models there are the schemas and also validation.

In the routes there are the links.

In the controllers, the routes are connected to the views and models.

In the views are the view files.

The public folder has the CSS, JS, and publicly accessible files.
